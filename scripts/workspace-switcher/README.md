# Workspace switcher
Simple script to change to the next or previous workspace / virtual desktop written in bash.

Change to the next workspace by passing "next" as an argument and to the previous with "prev" as an argument.

Tested and used with [Xfce](https://xfce.org/) how ever should work with any desktop environment or window manager which is compatible with the EWMH/NetWM specification.

Run with:<br>```./swap-workspace.sh bar.py [next|prev]```
